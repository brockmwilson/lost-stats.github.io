# Moving Average (MA) Models

Moving Average Models are a common method for modeling linear processes that exhibit serial correlation. This can take many forms, but an easy example is weather patterns. 

Imagine we modelled Ski Lift Purchases over a 5 consecutive weekday period. Let weather shocks be identically and independently distributed. A weather shock with large amounts of snow would cause more individuals to go ski. This shock would have future impacts on ski ticket purchases; individuals tomorrow will go skiing due
to the snowfall today. This means when we think of the process, we should account for previous shock effects on outcomes today:

$$
SkiTicketPurchases_t = \mu + \theta_1*Weather_t + \theta_2*Weather_{t-1}
$$

## Definition

Let $$\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon})$$. A moving average
process, which is denoted MA(q), take the form as:

$$
y_t = \mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + ... + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q}
$$

Note that a MA(q) process has *q lagged $$\epsilon$$ terms*. Thus a MA(1)
process would take the form:

$$
y_t = \mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1}
$$

## Properties of a MA(1) process:

1. The mean is constant. 

$$
E(y_t) = E(\mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1}) = \mu
$$

2. The variance is constant. 

$$
Var(y_t) = Var(\mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1}) = (1 + \theta_1^2) * \sigma^2_{\epsilon}  $$

3. The covariance between $$y_t$$ and $$y_{t-q}$$ is decreasing as $$q \to \infty$$. 

$$
Cov(y_t, y_{t-1}) = E(y_t*y_{t-1}) - E(y_t)E(y_{t-1}) \\
    = E([\mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1}] [\mu + \epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-2}]) - \mu^2 \\
    = \mu^2 + \theta_1 \sigma_{\epsilon}^2 -\mu^2 \\
    = \theta_1 \sigma_{\epsilon}^2
$$

$$
Cov(y_t, y_{t-2}) = E(y_t*y_{t-2}) - E(y_t)E(y_{t-2}) \\
= E([\mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1}] [\mu + \epsilon_{t-2} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-3}]) - \mu^2 \\
= \mu^2 -\mu^2 \\
= 0
$$

## Keep in Mind

- Time series data needs to be properly formatted (e.g.Â date columns should be formatted into a time)
- Model Selection uses the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), or the Akaike Information Criterion corrected (AICc) to determine the appropriate number of terms to include. Refer to [Wikipedia:Model Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection#Criteria) for further information.

# Implementations

## R

```r
#in the stats package we can simulate an ARIMA Model. ARIMA stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model. We will be setting the AR and I parts to 0 and only simulating a MA(q) model.
set.seed(123)
DT = arima.sim(n = 1000, model = list(ma = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5)))
```

```r
plot(DT, ylab = "Value")
```

![A plot of our data generating process; x-axis is time and y-axis is the values produced.](Images/MA_Model/plot1.png)

```r
#ACF stands for Autocorrelation Function
#Here we can see that there may be potential for 3 lags in our MA process. (Note: This is due to property (3): the covariance of y_t and y_{t-3} is nonzero while the covariance of y_t and y_{t-4} is 0)
acf(DT, type = "covariance")
```

![A plot of the autocorrelation function: this shows the correlation between $y_t$ and different lagged values of $y_t$. The first four correlations (starting with the correlation of $y_t$ and $y_t$) are positive and then the rest are close to 0; this is what we would expect from the data generating process.](Images/MA_Model/ACF.png)

```r
#Here I'm estimating an ARIMA(0,0,3) model which is a MA(3) model. Changing c(0,0,q) allows us to estimate a MA(q) process.
arima(x = DT, order = c(0,0,3))
```

#We can also estimate a MA(7) model and see that the ma4, ma5, ma6, and ma7 are close to 0 and insignificant.
arima(x = DT, order = c(0,0,7))

#fable is a package designed to estimate ARIMA models. We can use it to estimate our MA(3) model.

#an extension of tidyverse to temporal data (this allows us to create time series data into tibbles which are needed for fable functionality)
library(tsibble)
#visit https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/ to understand dplyr syntax; this package is important for fable functionality
library(dplyr)
```

```r
#When using the fable package, we need to convert our object into a tsibble (a time series tibble). This gives us a data frame with values and an index for the time periods
DT = DT %>%
  as_tsibble()

head(DT)

#if instead we want to specify the model manually, we need to specify it. For MA models, set the pdq(0,0,q) term to the MA(q) order you want to estimate. For example: Estimating a MA(7) would mean that I should put pdq(0,0,7). Additionally, you can add a constant if wanted; this is shown below
